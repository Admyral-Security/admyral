# No-Code Editor

The No-Code Editor is the alternative to coding your workflows in Python using Admyral's SDK. Every workflow is displayed in No-Code as well as in code.

## Why having a No-Code editor when also offering Python code?

-   Enable the rest of the GRC team to build workflows and make adjustments
-   Easier to communicate with non-technical stakeholders (visualization vs. code)
-   Quickly create simple automations

## Overview

The workflow builder is split up in three parts:

1. On the left panel, you can drag-and-drop new pre-built and custom actions and integrations.
2. In the middle, you can use the drag-and-drop functionality of the actions to build and adjust workflows.
3. On the right panel, you can make changes to the workflow's meta information such as changing the name of the workflow or adding an description. The right panel appears upon clicking on the "_Settings_" button on the top right.
   However, if you have selected an action on the canvas in the middle, this panel changes and you can configure the action.

## Workflow Naming

Before being able to save a workflow, you must give your a workflow a **unique** name without whitespaces (e.g., `retool_access_review_workflow`).
The workflow name will also be the name of the workflow function in Code.

## References

In order to use the output of an action, you need to first give the action from which you want to use the output a result name. Simply click on an action and
define the `Result Name` field. Result names must be in `snake_case`.

In order to pass the `jira_issues` result as an argument to an action, simply use the following pattern: `{{ jira_issues }}`

The double curly brackets indicate that it is a reference. Inside the reference, you can use Python syntax to access nested data from JSON arrays or objects.
Use numbers to access the index of an array and strings to access values by key in an object.

Example for accessing the ID field of the first Jira issue (`jira_issues` is an array of JSON objects):

```
{{ jira_issues[0]["id"] }}
```

Example if you want to pass all the Jira issues as input to some action:

```
{{ jira_issues }}
```

<Callout type="info">
	Tip: In order to construct references more easily, check out the run
	history. There, you can inspect the output of an executed action.
</Callout>

## Executing Workflows

<Callout type="info">
	Make sure you have activated the workflow for it to be able to execute.
</Callout>

When you build workflows, they must start with the start node. As soon as this input action is triggered, e.g. by an external API call in the case of a webhook or a schedule,
the workflow is executed automatically.

You can always test workflows manually to ensuring they are set up properly by clicking on the "_Run_" button.
