# If-Condition

The If-Condition action serves as a decision node in the Workflow Builder, allowing for the branching of workflow paths based on evaluated conditions. 
This is particularly useful in security workflows, where actions must be determined by the nature of the threat or status reported by a system.

## Adding an If-Condition in Workflow Builder
To implement decision-based logic in your workflows, the If-Condition action is used to create a fork in the process, directing the flow toward 
different actions depending on whether the set condition evaluates to true or false.


Each If-Condition in the Workflow Builder has two paths:

- **True Path**: The direction the workflow takes if the condition evaluates to true.
- **False Path**: The direction the workflow takes if the condition evaluates to false.

*Note: It is possible to only use one of the above paths.*

## Configurable Fields for If-Condition

The following table lists the fields that can be configured for an If-Condition:

| Field              | Description                                                                           | Configurable |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------:|
| **Name**           | Identifies the condition and its purpose within the workflow.                          |      Yes     |
| **Reference Handle** | Serves as an identifier for the condition in code or integration points.              |      -     |
| **Description**    | Provides details about the condition's purpose and how it influences the workflow.    |      Yes     |
| **IF**             | The logical expression which compares two values (first text field, last text field) with operators such as 'equals', 'not equals', 'greater than', etc.    |      Yes     |


### The IF-Field Explained

TODO Add image

* You enter the data point you are evaluating
* Select a logical operator:
    * equals
    * does not equals
    * is great than
    * is great than or equal to
    * is less than
    * is less than or equal to
* Below each logical operator, there is a value field where you define the value that the data point is being compared to.
* Through clicking on the "+" on the bottom you can add more conditions. This is used to add additional conditions that must also be true for the action 
to follow the 'True' path.



## Examples of If-Condition

### Example 1: Alert Severity Check

* **Name**: `Check Alert Severity`
* **Description**: `Determines if an alert's severity level is 'High' and directs the workflow based on this condition.`
* **Value1**: `alert_severity`
* **Condition**: `equals`
* **Value2**: `High`

Path in the Workflow:
* **True Path**: `Immediate Escalation Action`
* **False Path**: `Standard Review Process`


### Example 2: Validate Incident Report Completion

* **Name**: `Incident Report Completion Check`
* **Description**: `Evaluates whether an incident report has been completed within the required timeframe.`
* **Value1**: `status`
* **Condition**: `equals`
* **Value2**: `Completed`
* **AND**
* **Value1**: `completed_within_SLA`
* **Condition**: `equals`
* **Value2**: `true`

Path in the Workflow:
* **True Path**: `Close Incident Ticket`
* **False Path**: `Escalate to Incident Manager`


### Example 3: System Health status

* **Name**: `System Health Check`
* **Description**: `Assesses the system's health status and decides the next action based on stability.`
* **Value1**: `system_status`
* **Condition**: `equals`
* **Value**: `Stable`

Path in the Workflow:
* **True Path**: `Maintain Normal Operations`
* **False Path**: `Initiate Recovery Protocols`


### Example 4: Check for Security Patch Application
* **Name**: `Security Patch Application Verification`
* **Description**: `Confirms if a security patch has been applied to vulnerable systems.`
* **Value1**: `patch_status`
* **Condition**: `equals`
* **Value**: `Applied`

Path in the Workflow:
* **True Path**: `Log Patch Success`
* **False Path**: `Attempt Patch Reapply`


In these examples, the If-Condition action allows security workflows to make automated decisions based on the current status or outcome of a 
given security process, enhancing the workflow's efficiency and effectiveness.
