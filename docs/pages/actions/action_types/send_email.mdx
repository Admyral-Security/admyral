# Send Email Action

The Send Email action is used to configure and automate the process of sending emails. This action can be leveraged for notifications, alerts, or any 
communication that should be sent as a response to triggers within the workflow.

Adding a Send Email action to your workflow automates the process of sending out predefined emails, which can be critical in a security context for 
timely alerts or updates.
