2. In the left-side panel, go to **Interactivity & Shortcuts**.

3. Click the toggle to turn interactivity on.

## Scenario 1: Admyral API Server is reachable from the Internet

4. In order to receive the events from Slack, you need to make Admyral publicly available. If you are running locally, you can install a tunneling agent, such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).

5. If you installed ngrok, you can simply make the port on which Admyral is running locally, e.g., on port `8000`, publicly available with the following command:

    ```bash
    ngrok http 8000
    ```

    It will return a forwarding URL.

6. Next, follow the steps from **Scenario 2** but replace `https://api.admyral.dev` with the forwarding URL from ngrok.

## Scenario 2: Admyral API Server is reachable from the Internet

4. Input the webhook URL, e.g., `https://api.admyral.dev/webhooks/332c5a8c-0cf2-4306-9541-cc9d590e7e8b` and append the webhook secret for authentication, i.e.,

````
https://api.admyral.dev/webhooks/332c5a8c-0cf2-4306-9541-cc9d590e7e8b/3903100d842c6bb4732d1073edaa18e5e8be5a61809913dd15b1202aaedd5fd9
```,
of the workflow receiving the interactivity events.

5. Click on **Save Changes**.
