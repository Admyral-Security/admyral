# Receiving Microsoft Teams Events

The Outgoing Webhook functions like a bot by monitoring channels for messages that include @mentions. It notifies an external web
service and can respond with rich messages, such as cards and images. This allows users to bypass the need to create bots via the Microsoft Bot Framework.

Review the [Microsoft Teams Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-outgoing-webhook?tabs=urljsonpayload%2Cdotnet) for more information.
