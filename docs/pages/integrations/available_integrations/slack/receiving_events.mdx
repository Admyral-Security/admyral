# Receiving Slack Events

In order to receive events from Slack, you need to set up an event subscription in your Slack app. This allows Slack to send events that you specify which triggers a workflow in Admyral. Follow the steps below to set up event subscriptions:

1. Go to the [Your Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) page and continue to the app you created for Admyral.

2. Go to **Event Subscriptions**

4. Go to your workflow in Admyral which should process the incoming Slack events. Add a **Start Workflow** action, click on the action node, and select **Event-based Workflow Execution** as **Start Workflow Type**.

5. Copy the API URL from the **Start Workflow** action and paste it in the **Request URL** field in the **Event Subscriptions** page in Slack. Admyral automatically handles the Slack [URL verification challenge](https://api.slack.com/apis/events-api#handshake).
