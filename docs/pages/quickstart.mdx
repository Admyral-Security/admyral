# Quickstart: Run Your First Workflow

This quickstart helps you to create your first workflow automation within Admyral. The workflow performs a simple URL check using the community version of VirusTotal.

**Prerequisites**:

-   Python 3.12 (Download [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/), your favorite package manager, such as `brew`, or something similar to [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#installation))
-   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)
-   [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) (Recommended installation via `pipx`: `pipx install poetry`) **if you use our [Admyral Quickstart Github Repo](https://github.com/Admyral-Security/admyral-quickstart)**

## Getting Started

You can create your first workflow within less than 10 minutes:

<Callout type="info">
	You can also clone the [Admyral Quickstart Github
	Repo](https://github.com/Admyral-Security/admyral-quickstart) to follow
	along.
</Callout>

<Steps>
### Step 0: Verify your Setup

Admyral requires Python 3.12 to be installed. You can check whether you have Python 3.12 installed by running the following:

```bash
python --version
```

Additionally, Docker must be installed and should be running. You can verify that Docker is installed and the Docker daemon is running by executing the following command:

```bash
docker ps
```

### Step 1: Installing and Starting Admyral

To install Admyral, simply install the Admyral pip package using your favorite dependency management tool:

<Tabs items={['Pip', 'Poetry', 'Conda']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        ```bash
        pip install admyral
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>

    <Tabs.Tab>
        ```bash
        poetry add admyral
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>

    <Tabs.Tab>
        ```bash
        conda install admyral
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

<details>
    <summary> Optionally, specify custom ports for the needed services </summary>
    
    Copy the content of `.env.example` file to a new file called `.env`:    
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Open the `.env` file and adjust the ports as needed.

    Source the `.env` file to load the environment variables:

    ```bash
    source .env
    ```

</details>

To launch Admyral use the following command:

```bash
admyral up
```

You can open the Admyral UI by visiting http://localhost:3000 in your browser. If a custom port was defined using `ADMYRAL_WEB_PORT`, use the defined port number instead of `3000`.

### Step 2: Tool and Secret Setup

Now, let's get a VirusTotal API Key. If you don't have a VirusTotal account, sign up [here](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/join-us) for free.
Then, click on your name on the top right, select `API Key`, and copy your API key.

With Admyral offering a _CLI_ as well as a _web UI_, you can decide how you'd like to set up your VirusTotal secret.

<Tabs items={['CLI', 'Admyral UI']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        To create a secret using the CLI, use the following CLI command: 
        ```bash 
        admyral secret set secret_name --value key1=value1 --value key2=value2
        ```
        For our quickstart, navigate in your terminal to your admyral repository and enter the following but replacing `your_copied_virus_total_api_key` with your copied API key:
        ```bash
        admyral secret set virus_total --value api_key=your_copied_virus_total_api_key
        ```

    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        Go to Admyral running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). If a custom port was defined using `ADMYRAL_WEB_PORT`, use the defined port number instead of `3000`.
        1. Select "Add new secret"
        2. Secret name: `virus_total` (*any other name works as well*)
        3. Key: `api_key`
        4. Value: `your_copied_virus_total_api_key`
        5. Save it

     </Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

### Step 3: Create your workflow

With Admyral, you can decide whether you want to build your workflows with `Code` or `No-Code`.

<Tabs items={['Code', 'No-Code']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>

        We recommend to setup a Github project for managing your workflows. You can check out our [Quickstart Github Repo](https://github.com/Admyral-Security/admyral-quickstart). Feel free to clone it and use
        it for your setup or simply just get inspired.

        Open your project with your favorite IDE and create a new Python file named `virus_total_workflow.py` for the workflow.
        Within this newly created file, your new workflow automation is being created using Python code.

        Let's start with building your first workflow function. This function has the `@workflow` decorator and defines the the control flow of our workflow automation.

        ```python
        from admyral.workflow import workflow
        from admyral.typings import JsonValue

        @workflow
        def virus_total_workflow(payload: dict[str, JsonValue]):
            # will be completed soon
        ```

        The workflow function must always have the parameter `payload: dict[str, JsonValue]` defined. No other parameters for the workflow function are allowed.

        The function name `virus_total_workflow`, also called workflow name, is used as an identifier for your workflow and must be unique across all your workflows.

        Additionally, we need the corresponding imports. In this case, it is `from admyral.workflow import workflow` for the workflow decorator as well as `from admyral.actions import virus_total_analyze_url` for the integration action.
        For the latter, we are using the pre-built integration to analyze a URL which takes a URL as a string such as `www.example.org` and returns a JSON. The return value is the
        regular return value you'd receive from the [VirusTotal Scan URL API](https://docs.virustotal.com/reference/scan-url).
        With this knowledge, we can now create the workflow using plain Python:

        ```python
        from admyral.workflow import workflow
        from admyral.typings import JsonValue
        from admyral.actions import virus_total_analyze_url

        @workflow
        def virus_total_workflow(payload: dict[str, JsonValue]):
            virus_total_analyze_url(payload["url"])
        ```

        To use our previously stored secret for VirusTotal, we add the secret mapping `secrets={"TOOL_SECRET": "secret_name"}` as the last argument of an integration. In our case, it would look like the following:

        ```python
        from admyral.workflow import workflow
        from admyral.typings import JsonValue
        from admyral.actions import virus_total_analyze_url

        @workflow()
        def virus_total_workflow(payload: dict[str, JsonValue]):
            virus_total_analyze_url(
                url=payload["url"],
                secrets={"VIRUS_TOTAL_SECRET": "virus_total"}
            )
        ```

        Performing the access `payload["url"]` implies that we always expect
        a JSON body which contains a field called `url` be sent to the webhook. For example:

        ```json
        {
            "url": "www.example.org"
        }
        ```

        For more information about secrets, please refer to [Secrets Management](/secrets).

        Now, we add a trigger and a description (optional) to the workflow automation. Admyral supports event-based triggers (webhook) as well as scheduled triggers.
        Either has to be imported `from admyral.workflow import Webhook` for event-based execution or `from admyral.workflow import Schedule` for a scheduled workflow execution.
        You can also omit defining a trigger since you can always execute your workflows using manual execution via the CLI (`admyral workflow trigger ...`) or in the Admyral UI.
        In this quickstart, we opt to create a webhook:

        ```python
        from admyral.workflow import workflow, Webhook
        from admyral.typings import JsonValue
        from admyral.actions import virus_total_analyze_url

        @workflow(
            description="Analyze a URL using VirusTotal",
            triggers=[Webhook()]
        )
        def virus_total_workflow(payload: dict[str, JsonValue]):
            virus_total_analyze_url(
                url=payload["url"],
                secrets={"VIRUS_TOTAL_SECRET": "virus_total"}
            )
        ```

        Now, you have created the workflow. The last step is to push the workflow to the Admyral infrastructure.
        We use the following push command from the CLI to push the workflow:
        ```bash
        admyral workflow push workflow_name -f path_to_your_workflow_file.py
        ```

        If you saved your workflow in `workflows/virus_total_workflow.py`, the command is:
        ```bash
        admyral workflow push virus_total_workflow -f workflows/virus_total_workflow.py
        ```

        You can open the Admyral UI by visiting http://localhost:3000 in your browser. If a custom port was defined using `ADMYRAL_WEB_PORT`, use the defined port number instead of `3000`.
        There, you should find the workflow and can inspect the workflow inside the No-Code editor.

    </Tabs.Tab>

    <Tabs.Tab>

        1. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your favorite browser. If a custom port was defined using `ADMYRAL_WEB_PORT`, use the defined port number instead of `3000`.
        2. Click on `Create New Workflow` on the top right.
        3. In Workflow Settings, give the workflow a name, e.g. `virus_total_workflow`. The workflow name must be in `snake_case`.
        4. Save the workflow by clicking on the `Save` button.
        4. On the left sidepanel, click on the VirusTotal dropdown and drag+drop the `Analyze URL` action on the canvas.
        Then, connect the start node with the newly created `Analyze URL` action. It should look like the following:

        <div align="center">
            <br />
            ![No-Code Editor](/no_code_quickstart.png)
        </div>
        _No-Code Editor: Start and VirusTotal Analyze URL Action_

        To finish it off, the VirusTotal action has to be configured:
        1. Optional: Enter a result name, `analyzed_url`, to later use the output of `Analyze URL` in another action
        2. Enter the secret name for the action: `virus_total`
        3. Fill out the arguments of the `Analyze URL` action. In this case, it is just the URL argument: `www.example.org`

        <Callout type="warning">
            When you enter a URL in the URL field in VirusTotal's configuration panel on the right, everytime the workflow is executed, the same URL will be analyzed.
            To avoid this, you would like to leverage the input from the webhook (event-based execution of the workflow).
        </Callout>

        To create a dynamic input, you can refer to the input coming from the webhook. Whenever the webhook is called (= an event happened), we require to send an url with it as well.
        For this, click on the Start action and then on the "+" next to webhook.

        To refer to a previous input, we use `{{ <input> }}`.
        With this in mind, we can reference the URL dynamically within the VirusTotal action using the following reference: `{{ payload["url"] }}`. This implies that we always expect
        a JSON body which contains a field called `url` be sent to the webhook. For example:

        ```json
        {
            "url": "www.example.org"
        }
        ```

        Note: *payload* is the Result Name of the Start node (see right sidepanel).

        Enter the reference above in the URL field for the VirusTotal action.

        Lastly, click on "Save" on the top bar to save all the changes.
    </Tabs.Tab>

**Finished!**

### Step 4: Execute Your Workflow

Upon building our workflow, you can activate and execute your workflow. Again, you have two options for each action: (1) Using the CLI or (2) using the Admyral UI.

<Tabs items={['CLI', 'Admyral UI']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        #### Activate the workflow
        To activate a workflow type in the CLI:
        ```bash
        admyral workflow activate your_workflow_name
        ```

        As we called the workflow function `virus_total_workflow`, use the following command:
        ```bash
        admyral workflow activate virus_total_workflow
        ```

        #### Execute the workflow
        Upon activation, the workflow can be executed. The CLI command to trigger a workflow is:

        ```bash
        admyral workflow trigger your_workflow_name
        ```

        So similar to above, the command to use is:
        ```bash
        admyral workflow trigger virus_total_workflow --payload '{
            "url": "www.example.org"
        }'
        ```

    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>

        #### Activate the workflow

        Upon clicking on "Save", you can simply use the toggle on the top right to switch the workflow status from "Inactive" to "Active".

        #### Execute the workflow

        On the top right, click on "Run" to execute the workflow manually. A modal opens in which you can enter a payload. As the workflow requires the URL
        and as we have used `{{ payload["url"] }}` as a reference, we have to add a test payload. The payload is in JSON format and looks like the following:

        ```json
        {
            "url": "www.example.org"
        }
        ```

        Copy the code above and paste it in the payload textbox that popped up. Click on "Run workflow" to start the execution.

        <Callout type="info">
            To see the details of the workflow execution, go to the [Run History](/run_history).
        </Callout>
    </Tabs.Tab>
