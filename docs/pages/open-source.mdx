# Open Source

Admyral is open-source for the following reasons:

- To establish transparency and trust with our users
- To enable the community to self-host and contribute to Admyral
- To collaborate on integrations and features with the community because users know best what a security automation platform should look like

## License

Admyral is licensed under an [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/Admyral-Security/admyral/blob/main/LICENSE).

Currently, our focus is entirely on open source. However, we may consider commercializing premium features as part of an enterprise version in the future. For specific requirements, please contact us at chris@admyral.dev

## Self-host vs Admyral Cloud
The Admyral team provides Admyral Cloud as a managed solution to simplify the initial setup of Admyral and to minimize the operational overhead of maintaining high availability in production. Get started for free on: https://admyral.dev.

Alternatively, Admyral can be used locally and self-hosted using Docker. Please review our docs on [Self-hosting](https://docs.admyral.dev/setup/docker).
