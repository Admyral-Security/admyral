# Open-Source

Admyral is open-source for the following reasons:

-   To establish transparency and trust with our users
-   To enable the community to self-host and contribute to Admyral
-   To collaborate on integrations and features with the community because users know best what a security automation platform should look like

## License and Commercial Use

Admyral is licensed under an [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/Admyral-Security/admyral/blob/main/LICENSE).

It can be used commercially hosted by you. When using this free option, you will only receive community support. In case you prefer hosting by Admyral or require advanced support or SSO authentication, we'd suggest the enterprise plan. For more details, contact us at chris@admyral.dev or directly on [Discord](https://discord.gg/GqbJZT9Hbf).

## Self-host vs Admyral Cloud

The Admyral team provides Admyral Cloud as a managed solution to simplify the initial setup of Admyral and to minimize the operational overhead of maintaining high availability in production. Try it out on: https://admyral.dev.

Alternatively, Admyral can be used locally and self-hosted using Docker. Please review our docs on [Self-hosting](https://docs.admyral.dev/docker).
