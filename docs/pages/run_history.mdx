## Reviewing Workflow Executions

To review the execution history of your workflows, follow these steps:

1. Click on the **Workflow Runs** tab on the top of the Workflow Builder.
2. You will see a list of runs for the specific workflow with corresponding dates and times for quick reference.

## Understanding Workflow Run Details

Each workflow run is listed with the following information:

-   **Date, Time:** The exact date and time when the workflow was triggered.
-   **Routes:** Displayed in the second column. A representation of the individual steps the workflow took during execution.
-   **Action Details:** In the third column details of each executed action are displayed such as an input arguments, the result/output, and logs (if available). In most cases, logs are displayed only for custom actions they were set up that way.
