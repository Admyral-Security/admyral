# Introduction

Whether your goal is to reduce your MTTR, try to accomplish more with less, decrease the amount of manual tasks, or standardize your operations, automation can help. When creating and managing automations, there used to be only extremes:
(1) go full code and write Python scripts or (2) go full No-Code and build No-Code automations.
There is no suitable solution available that combines the best of both worlds until now.

Welcome to Admyral!

## Why Admyral?

-   Seamless combination of the flexibility of code and speed of No-Code
-   Tailored for Security Engineers with a Code-first approach
-   Usable by less technical team members through a intuitive No-Code Workflow Builder
-   Automations are stored in code which reduces a vendor-lockin
-   Leverage software-engineering best practices (testing, CI/CD, version control, etc.)
-   Built with scalability in mind
-   Open-source

## Introduction to Automation with Admyral

In Admyral, there are 3 building blocks for automations:

<Cards>
	<Card
    	title="Pre-defined actions"
    	href="/pre_defined_actions"
        arrow
    />
    <Card
    	title="Integrations"
    	href="/integrations/integrations"
        arrow
    />
    <Card
    	title="Custom Actions"
    	href="/custom_actions"
        arrow
    />

</Cards>

These three building blocks can be used to create automations within Admyral -- either in [No-Code](/no_code_editor) or [code](/automation_as_code).
However, you can always decide to switch from No-Code to code and vice verca depending on your needs. Admyral supports a bi-directional synchronization to enable a seamless swtich.
