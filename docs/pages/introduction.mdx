# Introduction

Whether your goal is to monitor your security controls, try to accomplish more with less, decrease the amount of manual tasks, or standardize your operations, automation helps. When creating and managing automations in GRC, there used to be only extremes:
(1) keep doing everything manually or (2) utilize rigid GRC software that usually doesn't fit your processes, your environment, or your custom controls.
There is no suitable solution available that combines the flexibility of code with the promise to actually fit your automation needs until now.

Welcome to Admyral!

## Why Admyral?

-   Seamless combination of the flexibility of code and speed and simplicity of No-Code
-   Tailored for GRC Engineers with an as code approach
-   Usable by any GRC team members through a intuitive No-Code Workflow Builder
-   Automations are stored in code which reduces a vendor lock-in
-   Leverage software engineering best practices (testing, CI/CD, version control, etc.)
-   Built with scalability in mind
-   Open-source

## Introduction to Automation with Admyral

In Admyral, there are 3 building blocks for automations:

<Cards>
	<Card
    	title="Pre-defined actions"
    	href="/pre_defined_actions"
        arrow
    />
    <Card
    	title="Integrations"
    	href="/integrations/integrations"
        arrow
    />
    <Card
    	title="Custom Actions"
    	href="/custom_actions"
        arrow
    />

</Cards>

These three building blocks can be used to create automations within Admyral -- either in [No-Code](/no_code_editor) or [code](/automation_as_code).
However, you can always decide to switch from No-Code to code and vice verca depending on your needs. Admyral supports a bi-directional synchronization to enable a seamless swtich.
