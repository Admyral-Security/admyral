# Secrets Management

Secrets management allows users to securely store and manage API keys and tokens that applications use to authenticate to external services.

<Callout type="info">
	It is important to ensure that secrets are kept up-to-date and are only
	accessible to authorized personnel to maintain the security of your
	integrations.
</Callout>

	List all secrets through the CLI using `admyral secret list`.
</Callout>

Secrets are always stored as key-value pairs where both, the key and the value, are strings. A secret consists of one or more key-value pairs.

The following terms are important to understand for users:

-   **Secret**: A secret consists of multiple key-value pairs of strings.

-   **Secret Placeholder**: If an action requires one or more secrets, it defines for each secret a secret placeholder for each secret it needs.
    The secret mapped to the placeholder is then used in the action logic in place of the placeholder.

    ```python
    @action(
    	display_name="Send Slack Message",
    	display_namespace="Slack",
    	# Secret placeholders are defined in the action decorator
    	secrets_placeholders=["SLACK_SECRET"],
    )
    def send_slack_message(...):
    	# Usage of the secret mapped to the secret placeholder
    	secret = ctx.get().secrets.get("SLACK_SECRET")
    	api_key = secret["api_key"]
    	...
    ```

-   **Secret Mapping**: Actions requiring secrets, such as integrations, define secret placeholders. For each secret placeholder, the user needs to
    define which secret the action should use in place of the secret placeholder. This is defined via the secret mapping either in the workflow function
    as code or in the UI in the action edit side panel.

## Adding and Using New Secrets in Workflows

    <Tabs.Tab>
		Secrets can easily be added via the CLI. You define key-value pairs by appending `--value` followed by a key-value assignment: `key=value`.

    	Example:

    	```bash
    	admyral secret set your_secret --value key1=value1 --value key2=value2
    	```

    	You can then use the secret, e.g. `your_secret` is `slack_secret`, as follows:

    	Some actions (e.g., integrations) require access to secrets. In order to give a secret access to a secret, you pass the name of the secret you want to use
    	to the action via the secrets mapping which maps a secret (`slack_secret`) to a secret placeholder (`SLACK_SECRET`) defined by the action. If an action
    	requires a secret, it is specified in the documentation.

    	```python
    	@workflow(
    		description="example_workflow",
    		triggers=[Webhook()],
    	)
    	def slack_send_message(payload: dict[str, JsonValue]):
    		send_slack_message(
    			channel_id="C0000000000",
    			text="This is how secrets are used within code.",
    			# Define the secrets mapping
    			secrets={
    				# we pass the slack_secret to the action by
    				# mapping it to the corresponding secret placeholder
    				# which is defined by the action.
    				"SLACK_SECRET": "slack_secret"
    			},
    		)
    	```

		Steps to setup a secret in the UI:
		
		1. Got to settings on the bottom left
		2. Click the `Add new secret` button to add a new set of secret.
		3. Enter the `Name` for the secret to be used as an identifier in your workflows or applications.
		4. Enter the `Value` which is the actual token or key that provides access.

    	Using a secret in the No-Code editor:

    	1. Drag & drop the action which you want to use
    	2. Click on the action node
    	3. If the action requires a secret, you can define the secrets mapping in the right side panel.

    	```

  	</Tabs.Tab>

  	<Tabs.Tab>
		1. Got to settings on the bottom left
		2. Search for the secret you want to delete in the secrets list.
		3. Click on the delete button (trash icon) to remove secrets that are no longer needed or should be revoked.
