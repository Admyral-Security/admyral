# Custom Actions

With Admyral's custom actions, you can build your own internal actions leveraging Python together with its rich ecosystem.
Custom actions are available as Python functions for your workflows defined in code as well as building blocks in the UI editor.

## Building Custom Actions

There are three ways to create custom actions:

1. As a Python function: <br/>
   a. Within the workflow Python file <br/>
   b. Within a Python file dedicated for the specific custom action

2. As a sub-part of the workflow function

### 1. Function

Using (1.a) or (1.b), the structure of the custom action is as follows:

Custom Action Structure:

```python
from admyral.action import action

@action(
    display_name="Send two Slack Messages",
    display_namespace="Slack",
    description="Send two Slack messages in a row to the same person",
)
def send_two_slack_messages():
    ...
```

The following metadata fields defined in the `@action` decorator is used for rendering the custom action in the no-code editor and providing information about the action to the user.

-   `display_name` (Required): The name displayed on the action building blocks in the no-code editor.
-   `display_namespace` (Required): The group under which the action will be rendered in the left sidebar of the no-code editor.
-   `description` (Optional): Description of the action.

#### Supported Action and Return Types

Currently, Admyral only supports JSON-serializable types as input and output for actions, i.e., the following types are supported:

-   `str`
-   `None`
-   `bool`
-   `int`
-   `float`
-   `list` consisting of JSON-serializable types
-   `dict` consisting of JSON-serializable types
-   our custom type representing a JSON-serializable type: `JsonValue` (Usage: `from admyral.typings import JsonValue`)

#### Action Arguments and Return Types

Action arguments are simple function arguments. However, each argument must be typed as well as annotated with `ArgumentMetadata` which is used to populate the UI.
Hence, the following format is used as type hint: `Annotated[<argument-type>, ArgumentMetadata(display_name="...", description="...")]`.

Additionally, it is highly recommended to also define a return type hint. If nothing is returned by the action, simply use `None` as return type.

Example:

```python
from typing import Annotated
from admyral.action import action, ArgumentMetadata
from admyral.typings import JsonValue

@action(
    display_name="Send two Slack Messages",
    display_namespace="Slack",
    description="Send two Slack messages in a row to the same person. Returns the API results.",
)
def send_two_slack_messages(
    user_id: Annotated[
        str,
        ArgumentMetadata(
            display_name="User ID",
            description="ID of the user which receives the messages."
        )
    ]
) -> list[JsonValue]:
    ...
```

You can also make an action argument optional by assigning a default value. This implies that you don't need to pass a value to the argument when calling the action in the workflow function:

```python
# ...

def send_two_slack_messages(
    user_id: Annotated[
        str,
        ArgumentMetadata(
            display_name="User ID",
            description="ID of the user which receives the messages."
        )
    ] = "this-is-my-default-user-id",
) -> list[JsonValue]:
    ...
```

Here is another example where the argument is optional and can be `None` in Python:

```python
# ...

def send_two_slack_messages(
    user_id: Annotated[
        str | None,
        ArgumentMetadata(
            display_name="User ID",
            description="ID of the user which receives the messages."
        )
    ] = None,
) -> list[JsonValue]:
    ...
```

#### Handling Secrets

If you need to use one or more secrets in your custom action, you need to define placeholders to which secrets are mapped when they are used in workflows.
You simpley define secret placeholders using the `secrets_placeholders` field of the `@action` decorator. To access the secret, you can load the secret
using the get secrets functionality provided by the action context `ctx.get().secrets.get("MY_PLACEHOLDER")`.

Decrypted secrets in Admyral are a simple string dictionary, i.e., `dict[str, str]`.

Example:

```python
from typing import Annotated
from admyral.action import action, ArgumentMetadata
from admyral.typings import JsonValue
from admyral.context import ctx # Include the action local context to access the secret

@action(
    display_name="Send two Slack Messages",
    display_namespace="Slack",
    description="Send two Slack messages in a row to the same person. Returns the API results.",
    # Define Secrets Placeholders here:
    secrets_placeholders=["SLACK_SECRET"]
)
def send_two_slack_messages(
    user_id: Annotated[
        str,
        ArgumentMetadata(
            display_name="User ID",
            description="ID of the user which receives the messages."
        )
    ]
) -> list[JsonValue]:
    # Usage of the secret mapped to the secret placeholder
    secret = ctx.get().secrets.get("SLACK_SECRET")
    api_key = secret["api_key"]
    ...
```

In the workflow function, you map a secret (e.g., `my_stored_slack_secret`) to the secret placeholder (e.g., `SLACK_SECRET`) inside the `secrets` argument (Note: you don't need to ):

```python
send_two_slack_message(
    user_id="some_user_id",
    secrets={"SLACK_SECRET": "my_stored_slack_secret"}
)
```

This mapping then allows the action to load `my_stored_slack_secret` for `SLACK_SECRET`.

For more information see [Secrets Management](/secrets).

#### Handling Dependencies

In order to use pip packages inside your custom Python action, you need to add the needed packages to the `requirements` argument in the `@action` decorator:

```python
import requests
from boto3 import resource as aws_resource

@action(
    display_name="Requirements Example",
    display_namespace="Example",
    # define your requirements in the requirements list
    requirements=[
        # don't fix a version to always use the latest version
        "boto3",
        # you can also fix a version
        "requests==2.32.3"
    ]
)
def custom_action() -> None:
    r = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/pass', auth=('user', 'pass'))

    # Note: ignoring credentials here
    s3 = aws_resource('s3')
```

#### Using Existing Actions inside your Custom Action

You can also build custom Python actions on top of existing pre-built or custom actions. You can simply call them.

**IMPORTANT:** You must make sure that the secrets placeholders of the used actions are also defined in the `secrets_placeholders` list of the new custom action.

```python
from typing import Annotated
from admyral.action import action, ArgumentMetadata
from admyral.typings import JsonValue
from admyral.context import ctx
# we import the existing send_slack_message
from admyral.actions import send_slack_message

@action(
    display_name="Send two Slack Messages",
    display_namespace="Slack",
    description="Send two Slack messages in a row to the same person. Returns the API results.",
    # The existing send_slack_message requires the SLACK_SECRET placeholder, so we must also add it to this action:
    secrets_placeholders=["SLACK_SECRET"]
)
def send_two_slack_messages(
    user_id: Annotated[
        str,
        ArgumentMetadata(
            display_name="User ID",
            description="ID of the user which receives the messages."
        )
    ]
) -> None:
    # we can simply call the actions here. the secrets are made available automatically.
    send_slack_message(
        channel_id=user_id,
        text="Message 1"
    )
    send_slack_message(
        channel_id=user_id,
        text="Message 2"
    )
```

#### Pushing Actions

After creating your custom action, push it to Admyral using the following CLI command to use it in other workflows or within the no-code editor:

```bash
admyral action <your_custom_action.py> push
```

#### Currently Unsupported Patterns

The following typical patterns are currently NOT supported (this might change in the future):

-   usage of variables defined outside of the action
-   usage of your own utility functions (Note: other actions or functions from pip packages are allowed)

### 2. Python Sections in the Workflow Function

<Callout type="warning">
	Custom Python sections in workflow functions are not yet released. They will
	be available within the upcoming weeks.
</Callout>

For way (2), defining custom actions within the workflow function, they have to be wrapped by two following two comments: `# {% custom %}` and `# {% endcustom %}`. In doing so, the custom action can be displayed
in the no-code editor as a single node, i.e., a Python script action. This implies that the code is only available within the particular workflow and it is not
usable by other workflows.

Python sections currently do **not** support third-party libraries, i.e., only the standard library is available within the section.
Third-party library support is only allowed in the Python function approach.

Example:

```python
@workflow
def workflow_function(payload: dict[str, JsonValue]):
    # some workflow logic

    # define the custom action enclosed by the following comments:

    # {% custom %}

    # just write normal Python code here
    alert_messages = []
    for alert in alerts:
        alert_messages.append({
        "channel": slack_channel_id,
        "text": f"New alert: {alert['name']}",
        "blocks": [
            {
            "type": "section",
            "text": {
                "type": "mrkdwn",
                "text": f"*{alert['description']}*"
                }
            }
        ]
    })

    # {% endcustom %}

    # continue you workflow logic here
```

In order to use the action within your workflow, you simply push your workflow as normal using `admyral workflow push ...`.

## Usage of Custom Actions

<Tabs items={['Code', 'No-Code']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        Import your custom action, e.g. `hello_world`, into your Python file to be able to use it
    	```python
        from admyral.actions import hello_world
        ```

        Use your imported custom action as a regular function:

        ```
    	@workflow(
    		description="example_workflow",
    		triggers=[Webhook()],
    	)
    	def slack_send_message(payload: dict[str, JsonValue]):
    		text = hello_world()

            send_slack_message(
    			channel_id="C0000000000",
    			text=text,
    			secrets={"SLACK_SECRET": "slack_secret"},
    		)
    	```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
    	Within the No-Code Workflow Editor, custom actions appear in the given namespace (= grouping), e.g. Slack or Admyral. From there, you can simply drag-and-drop them to use them.
    </Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>
