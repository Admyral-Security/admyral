## FAQ
#### What is the issue with the currenty Security Automation tools?
1. **Challenges of Staffing in Security Automation Implementation**: 
Security automation platforms promised to reduce the burden on security teams. However, they still require a dedicated team for building and managing automations, not addressing the ongoing issue of a skilled worker shortage.
-> Creating workflows should be made easier, more accessible, and faster.

2. **Automation Builders & Requesters vs. Automation Users**: 
Security Engineers are tasked with building automations while Managers drive their development based on input from the end users, aka Security Analysts. To complicate this, there's a lack of a feedback loop among these groups. 
-> Automation Users, e.g. Security Analysts, should be empowered to effortlessly create workflows during their regular workflow without creating additional overhead.

3. **Inflexibility of Static Workflows in a Dynamic Threat Environment**: 
Existing security automation platforms originated from generic workflow builders like Zapier and Make.com, designed for static environments and pre-GenAI era. In cybersecurity, where threats evolve rapidly, especially with GenAI-enhanced threats, static workflows are inadequate. It is impossible to constantly maintain and update static and predefined workflows.
-> Workflows is a dynamic concept that should welcome easy case-by-case adjustments during the incident investigation stage and beyond

Security Automation has to be rethought, which is why we are building Admyral, a next-generation hyperautomation platform. More details on the new concept will be shared as we progress.



#### How do you ensure Admyral is secure?
Please refer to [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/Admyral-Security/admyral/blob/main/SECURITY.md) for more detailed information.


#### What does your pricing look like?
As Admyral is still in its public alpha phase, we have not finalized a specific pricing structure yet. We invite interested organizations to reach out directly via email at [chris@admyral.com](mailto:chris@admyral.com) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/9ReNvc85) to discuss potential use cases and explore custom pricing options based on their needs and the scale of implementation.



#### Does Admyral stay open-source?
Admyral will maintain its commitment to keeping all currently open-sourced features available under the same open-source terms. However, future features specifically developed for enterprise use will not be open-sourced and will be available under different terms.



## Enterprise Version
As of now, our project does not have a dedicated Enterprise version.
If you represent an MSSP or an Enterprise and would like to discuss potential collaborations with Admyral, please do not hesitate to reach out. You can contact Chris directly at [chris@admyral.com](mailto:chris@admyral.com) for more details and to start a conversation.
We are excited about the possibility of working together to meet your specific business needs and to expand the capabilities of our project in a way that benefits your organization.
