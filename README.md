## ‚ùì FAQ

#### What is the issue with the current Security Automation tools?

1. **Challenges of Staffing in Security Automation Implementation**:
   Security automation platforms promised to reduce the burden on security teams. However, they still require a dedicated team for building and managing automations, not addressing the ongoing issue of a skilled worker shortage.

2. **Automation Builders & Requesters vs. Automation Users**:
   Security Engineers are tasked with building automations while Managers drive their development based on input from the end users, aka Security Analysts. To complicate this, there's a lack of a feedback loop among these groups.

3. **Inflexibility of Static Workflows in a Dynamic Threat Environment**:
   Existing security automation platforms originated from generic workflow builders and are designed for static environments and pre-GenAI era. In cybersecurity, where threats evolve rapidly, static workflows are inadequate. It is impossible to constantly maintain and update static and predefined workflows.

Overall, creating workflows should be made easier, more accessible, and faster. This enables automation users, e.g. Security Analysts, to effortlessly create workflows during their regular processes without creating additional overhead. To achieve this, we have to rethink the creation and overall concept of security automation. We believe that workflows is a dynamic concept that should welcome easy case-by-case adjustments during the incident investigation stage and beyond.

#### Why should security automation and case management be combined?

Security automation and case management are two sides of the same coin. Security automation is the process of automating security tasks, while case management is the process of managing security incidents. Combining the two allows for a more streamlined and efficient incident response process. By automating repetitive tasks and integrating automations into the case management process, security teams can respond to incidents more quickly and effectively. This integration also allows for better tracking and reporting of incidents, which can help organizations identify trends and improve their overall security posture.

#### How do you stay secure?

Visit [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/Admyral-Security/admyral/blob/main/SECURITY.md) for more details.

#### What does your pricing look like?

As Admyral is still in its public alpha phase, we have not finalized a specific pricing structure yet. We invite interested organizations to reach out directly via email at [chris@admyral.dev](mailto:chris@admyral.dev) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/GqbJZT9Hbf)/[Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/admyralcommunity/shared_invite/zt-2hqxj1xrr-YoWXYq7t8l3i5GyTCzEwPg) to discuss potential use cases and explore custom pricing options based on their needs and the scale of implementation.

#### Why is Admyral open-source?

We are open-source for the following reasons:

-   To establish transparency and trust with our users
-   To enable the community to self-host and contribute to Admyral
-   To collaborate on integrations and features with the community because users know best what a Cybersecurity Automation & Investigation Assistant should look like
-   To secure small- and medium-sized businesses, that have no budget for security

#### Does Admyral stay open-source?

We love open-source. Therfore, Admyral stays committed to keep all open-sourced features freely available under the same open-source terms and maintain them. However, future premium features may only be part of our enterprise version. For specific requirements, please reach out to us via [chris@admyral.dev](mailto:chris@admyral.dev).
