## Development Setup

For development setup, please refer to our documentation on [Admyral Docs](https://docs.admyral.dev/development_setup).

## Making a change

_Before making any significant changes, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Admyral-Security/admyral/issues)._ Discussing your proposed changes ahead of time will make the contribution process smooth for everyone. Large changes that were not discussed in an issue may be rejected.

Once we've discussed your changes and you've got your code ready, make sure that tests are passing and open your pull request.

A good first step is to search for open [issues](https://github.com/Admyral-Security/admyral/issues). Issues are labeled, and some good issues to start with are labeled: good first issue.
