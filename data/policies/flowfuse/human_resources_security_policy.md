### Screening

Background verification checks on FlowFuse personnel shall be carried out in accordance with relevant laws, regulations, and shall be proportional to the business requirements, the classification of the information to be accessed, and the perceived risks.

Required skills and competencies shall be listed in job descriptions and requisitions, and/or aligned with the responsibilities outlined in the Information Security Roles and Responsibilities Policy. Competency evaluations may include reference checks, education and certification verifications, technical testing, and interviews.

All FlowFuse employees will undergo an annual performance review which will include an assessment of job performance, competence in the role, adherence to company policies and code of conduct, and achievement of role-specific objectives.

### Management Responsibilities

Each policy owner shall be responsible for ensuring that information security policies and procedures are reviewed annually, available in the company handbook, and that employees and contractors abide by those policies and procedures for the duration of their employment or engagement.

The primary source for the policies is the company handbook. The review status of each policy is tracked in Vanta.

Annual policy reviews shall include a review of any linked or referenced procedures, standards or guidelines.

PeopleOps shall ensure that information security responsibilities are communicated to individuals, through written job descriptions, policies or some other documented method which is accurately updated and maintained.

Compliance with information security policies and procedures and fulfillment of information security responsibilities shall be evaluated as part of the performance review process wherever applicable.

Management shall consider excessive pressures, and opportunities for fraud when establishing incentives and segregating roles, responsibilities, and authorities.

### Information Security Awareness, Education & Training

All FlowFuse employees and third-parties with administrative or privileged technical access to FlowFuse production systems and networks shall complete security awareness training at the time of hire and annually thereafter.

This is managed via the Vanta platform.

In order to maintain a robust level of security awareness, the company will provide security-related updates and communications to company personnel on an on-going basis through the usual communication channels as needed.

### Termination Process

Employee and contractor termination and offboarding processes shall ensure that physical and logical access is promptly revoked in accordance with company SLAs and policies, and that all company issued equipment is returned.
