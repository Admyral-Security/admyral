title: Implementation of Logical Access Security Controls and Architecture for Protected Information Assets
description: >
    The entity implements logical access security software, infrastructure, and architectures over 
    protected information assets to protect them from security events to meet the entity's objectives.
# The following points of focus, specifically related to all engagements using the trust services cri- teria, highlight important characteristics relating to this criterion:

points_of_focus:
    - name: Identifies and Manages the Inventory of Information Assets
      description: >
          The entity identifies, inventories, classifies, and manages information assets.
    - name: Restricts Logical Access
      description: >
          Logical access to information assets, including hardware, data (at-rest, during processing, or in transmission), 
          software, administrative authorities, mobile devices, output, and offline system components is restricted through 
          the use of access control software and rule sets.
    - name: Identifies and Authenticates Users
      description: >
          Persons, infrastructure, and software are identified and authenticated prior to accessing information assets, 
          whether locally or remotely
    - name: Considers Network Segmentation
      description: >
          Network segmentation permits unrelated portions of the entity's information system to be isolated from each other.
    - name: Manages Points of Access
      description: >
          Points of access by outside entities and the types of data that flow through the points of access are identified, 
          inventoried, and managed. The types of individuals and systems using each point of access are identified, 
          documented, and managed.
    - name: Restricts Access to Information Assets
      description: >
          Combinations of data classification, separate data structures, port restrictions, access protocol restrictions, 
          user identification, and digital certificates are used to establish access-control rules for information assets.
    - name: Manages Identification and Authentication
      description: >
          Identification and authentication requirements are established, documented, and managed for individuals and systems 
          accessing entity information, infrastructure, and software.
    - name: Manages Credentials for Infrastructure and Software
      description: >
          New internal and external infrastructure and software are registered, authorized, and documented prior to being 
          granted access credentials and implemented on the network or access point. Credentials are removed and access is 
          disabled when access is no longer required or the infrastructure and software are no longer in use.
    - name: Uses Encryption to Protect Data
      description: >
          The entity uses encryption to supplement other measures used to protect data at rest, when such protections 
          are deemed appropriate based on assessed risk.
    - name: Protects Encryption Keys
      description: >
          Processes are in place to protect encryption keys during generation, storage, use, and destruction.
